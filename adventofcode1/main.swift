// --- Day 1: Chronal Calibration ---

//    After feeling like you've been falling for a few minutes, you look at the device's tiny screen. "Error: Device must be calibrated before first use. Frequency drift detected. Cannot maintain destination lock." Below the message, the device shows a sequence of changes in frequency (your puzzle input). A value like +6 means the current frequency increases by 6; a value like -3 means the current frequency decreases by 3.
//
//    For example, if the device displays frequency changes of +1, -2, +3, +1, then starting from a frequency of zero, the following changes would occur:
//
//    Current frequency  0, change of +1; resulting frequency  1.
//    Current frequency  1, change of -2; resulting frequency -1.
//    Current frequency -1, change of +3; resulting frequency  2.
//    Current frequency  2, change of +1; resulting frequency  3.
//    In this example, the resulting frequency is 3.
//
//    Here are other example situations:
//
//    +1, +1, +1 results in  3
//    +1, +1, -2 results in  0
//    -1, -2, -3 results in -6
//    Starting with a frequency of zero, what is the resulting frequency after all of the changes in frequency have been applied?

// Test Scenarios

//
//        --- Part Two ---
//    You notice that the device repeats the same frequency change list over and over. To calibrate the device, you need to find the first frequency it reaches twice.
//
//    For example, using the same list of changes above, the device would loop as follows:
//
//    Current frequency  0, change of +1; resulting frequency  1.
//    Current frequency  1, change of -2; resulting frequency -1.
//    Current frequency -1, change of +3; resulting frequency  2.
//    Current frequency  2, change of +1; resulting frequency  3.
//    (At this point, the device continues from the start of the list.)
//    Current frequency  3, change of +1; resulting frequency  4.
//    Current frequency  4, change of -2; resulting frequency  2, which has already been seen.
//    In this example, the first frequency reached twice is 2. Note that your device might need to repeat its list of frequency changes many times before a duplicate frequency is found, and that duplicates might be found while in the middle of processing the list.
//
//    Here are other examples:
//
//    +1, -1 first reaches 0 twice.
//    +3, +3, +4, -2, -4 first reaches 10 twice.
//    -6, +3, +8, +5, -6 first reaches 5 twice.
//    +7, +7, -2, -7, -4 first reaches 14 twice.
//    What is the first frequency your device reaches twice?
